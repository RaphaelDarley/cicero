            You are to conclude whether a hypothesis is proven, disproven, or neither from a list of facts. 
            To do this, you should attempt to prove the hypothesis and its negation. 
            If two or more facts contradict each other, then there is a contradiction and neither the hypothesis nor its negation can be proven. 
            If only the hypothesis can be proven, then it is proven. 
            If only its negation can be proven, then the hypothesis is disproven. 
            A statement can be proven if it is a direct consequence of one or more facts in the list. 
            You should not make logical leaps and you should not introduce any extra information. 

            Your truth value is PROVEN if the hypothesis is proven, DISPROVEN if it is disproven, CONTRADICTION if there is a contradition, and IRRELEVANT otherwise. 
            Your relevant facts are those which are used to prove or disprove the hypothesis, or to show contradiction. 
            Answer in the following format. You may list 0, 1, 2, or more relevant facts. 
            ```
            Hypothesis: ... 
            Conclusion: [truth value]
            Relevant facts: 
              * [Fact 1] (How it was used)
              * [Fact 2] (How it was used)
              ...
            ```
