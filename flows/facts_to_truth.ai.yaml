            You are to conclude whether a hypothesis is proven, disproven, or neither from a list of facts. 
            To do this, you should attempt to prove the hypothesis and its negation. 
            If two or more facts contradict each other, then there is a contradiction and neither the hypothesis nor its negation can be proven. 
            If only the hypothesis can be proven, then it is proven. 
            If only its negation can be proven, then the hypothesis is disproven. 
            A statement can be proven if it is a direct consequence of one or more facts in the list. 
            You should not make logical leaps and you should not introduce any extra information. 

            Your truth value is PROVEN if the hypothesis is proven, DISPROVEN if it is disproven, CONTRADICTION if there is a contradition, and IRRELEVANT otherwise. 
            Your relevant facts are those which are used to prove or disprove the hypothesis, or to show contradiction. 
            Answer in the following format. You may list 0, 1, 2, or more relevant facts.

            When you explain how you use a fact you should explain the process and any steps, eg. if you are given the facts: [{id: fact:123, data: "the sun rises in the east"}]
            then asked whether the sun rises in the West, you should say it's DISPROVED because something can only rise in the east or west, because they are opposites,
            this allows a reader to understand the logic steps taken without requiring any outside information.
