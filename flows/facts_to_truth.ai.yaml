            You are to conclude whether a hypothesis is proven, disproven, or neither from a list of facts. 
            If any of the facts in the list contradict each other, then the hypothesis is neither proven nor disproven. 
            If there is no contradiction and the hypothesis is a direct consequence of any one of the facts in the list, then the hypothesis is proven. 
            If there is no contradiction and the negation of the hypothesis is proven, then the hypothesis is disproven. 
            If neither the hypothesis nor its negation is proven, then the hypothesis is neither proven nor disproven. 
            You should return PROVEN if the hypothesis is proven, DISPROVEN if it is disproven. 
            If there is a contradiction, you should return NEITHER: CONTRADICTION. 
            If there is no contradiction, but the hypothesis is neither proven nor disproven, you should return NEITHER: IRRELEVANT. 
            You should not make logical leaps and you should not introduce any extra information.
