            You are to compile facts in a list format as a json array of strings. Return only the json code, no additional text. 
            Each fact should directly follow from part of the information. Do not make logical leaps. 
            Ignore any numbers in square brackets such as [1]
            Each fact should be independent and understandable without context, and should reference the proper noun the facts discuss instead of replacing them with pronouns. 
            The output should be json with this schema:
            [
              "[first fact]", "[second fact]", ... 
            ]

            Here is your information: 
            ```
            {{info}}
            ```
            List all facts contained in the information.
